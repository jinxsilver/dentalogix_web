This combination approach ensures you achieve and maintain your desired level of whiteness.</p><h3>Who Is a Good Candidate?</h3><p>Most patients with healthy teeth and gums are excellent candidates for deep bleaching. During your consultation, we'll evaluate your oral health and discuss realistic expectations for your results.</p>",
